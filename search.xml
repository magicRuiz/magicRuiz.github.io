    <title>Difference I found in A-Level center</title>
    <url>/2020/04/02/study-1/</url>
    <content><![CDATA[<p>I chose a quite different way with my initial classmates, which is the international education, for the following 3 years, I will make preparation for my university study in other countries. I really took a lot of time to get used to it , here are the differences I found between the study experience of me in international education and in the traditional education in China.</p>
<h2 id="About-the-teachers"><a href="#About-the-teachers" class="headerlink" title="About the teachers"></a>About the teachers</h2><p>The first lesson I took in the A-Level center is presented by a foreign teacher, whose accent was quite difficult for us to understand, after looking at the contents on the blackboard, I could get 50 percent of the points he taught, which was quite difficult for me at first. We all felt quite disappointed about the teachers in the center because we thought there might be many English teacher with good pronunciations. As one of the best English learner among us, I understood the meaning of our teachers faster than others, I found the teachers were really experienced and patient, they were all willing to help us one by one if we need,  which was a hard thing for the traditional Chinese teachers, that was because Chinese teachers were used to facing a  large amount of students at a time, some of the Chinese teachers would only tell things once so that some students could not get the points well, which was a difficult for me before. Teachers were also willing to have more communication with us , which really helped a lot with our speaking test. </p>
<h2 id="About-my-friends"><a href="#About-my-friends" class="headerlink" title="About my friends"></a>About my friends</h2><p>My classmates were quite different, after having the idea to study further in a foreign university, they were more likely to act as a international student, taking my friend Horan as an example, I found he even changed the language of his phone’s system after getting into the international lessons, I also changed my habit , I started to listen to BBC news instead of the Chinese radios, my friends gave me the idea about how to get used to the English environment. Edison from AS also gave me some help, once he took me to the teachers’ office to talk to our teachers for fun, I started to talk to my new teachers in English from then on with him, I do believe that this can make it much easier to know my teachers well if I keep talking to my teachers in English. This didn’t happen before, I didn’t talk much even with Chinese teachers. My friends really changed me a lot.</p>
<h2 id="About-the-learning-rhythm"><a href="#About-the-learning-rhythm" class="headerlink" title="About the learning rhythm"></a>About the learning rhythm</h2><p>After a quater of the study, it was the time for us to have a monthly exam, I was really surprised when I got to know there would be no revision class for our monthly test. I usually had a week for revision before the monthly test when I was in my junior high, which made most of my classmates only study in those specific weeks massively. Luckily, I did a good job in the beginning of the term in A-Level center, so I didn’t worry about the monthly test very much, simple work for revision after school was enough for me to get a high mark in the exams, from then, I started to realize the importance of the works between the monthly exams, so I worked harder on it than before. Many teachers of me told me that it was the right learning rhythm, but I think the habit was very hard to form when I was taking the traditional education because teachers before usually made the study process very short and give us a lot of time to review the contents, which made me very confused when reviewing. I think the IGCSE lesson we took didn’t have such a problem because we get the knowledge step by step, and the book for us was detailed so we can get all the points, I believe that I can learn better without getting confused and also form a better study habit than before.</p>
