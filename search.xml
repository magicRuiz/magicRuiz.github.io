    <title>Hollow Diamond and Pascal Triangle(The importance of encapsulation)</title>
    <url>/2020/06/17/Python3/</url>
    <content><![CDATA[<p>Lately I am trying to do some works about the programming questions that was initially set for visual basic learners (I chose the economic lesson instead of the computer science so I learn nothing about visual basic ). The only difference that I had with the VB learners was that I was using the Python.</p>
<hr>
<p><strong>The first question asked us to print a hollow diamond</strong></p>
<p>I divided the diamond into 2 parts: the top and bottom line and the regular lines (which are the middle lines)</p>
<p>I do so because the first and last lines are very special with only one character printed, so the formula will be different.</p>
<p><img src="https://s1.ax1x.com/2020/06/17/NZlgaT.png" alt="NZlgaT.png"></p>
<p>With the uses of  ‘for i in range’ , the task was completed.</p>
<figure class="highlight python"><table><tr><td class="code"><pre><span class="line">x=int(input())</span><br><span class="line">print(<span class="string">' '</span>*int((x<span class="number">-1</span>)/<span class="number">2</span>)+<span class="string">'*'</span>+<span class="string">' '</span>*int((x<span class="number">-1</span>)/<span class="number">2</span>))</span><br><span class="line"><span class="keyword">for</span> i <span class="keyword">in</span> range (<span class="number">2</span>,int((x+<span class="number">1</span>)/<span class="number">2</span>)+<span class="number">1</span>):</span><br><span class="line">    print(<span class="string">' '</span>*int((x+<span class="number">1</span>)/<span class="number">2</span>-i)+<span class="string">'*'</span>+<span class="string">' '</span>*int((i<span class="number">-2</span>)*<span class="number">2</span>+<span class="number">1</span>)+<span class="string">'*'</span>+<span class="string">' '</span>*int((x+<span class="number">1</span>)/<span class="number">2</span>-i))</span><br><span class="line"><span class="keyword">for</span> i <span class="keyword">in</span> range (int((x<span class="number">-1</span>)/<span class="number">2</span>),<span class="number">1</span>,<span class="number">-1</span>):</span><br><span class="line">    print(<span class="string">' '</span>*int((x+<span class="number">1</span>)/<span class="number">2</span>-i)+<span class="string">'*'</span>+<span class="string">' '</span>*int((i<span class="number">-2</span>)*<span class="number">2</span>+<span class="number">1</span>)+<span class="string">'*'</span>+<span class="string">' '</span>*int((x+<span class="number">1</span>)/<span class="number">2</span>-i))</span><br><span class="line">print(<span class="string">' '</span>*int((x<span class="number">-1</span>)/<span class="number">2</span>)+<span class="string">'*'</span>+<span class="string">' '</span>*int((x<span class="number">-1</span>)/<span class="number">2</span>))</span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure>

<figure class="highlight python"><table><tr><td class="code"><pre><span class="line"><span class="number">11</span></span><br><span class="line">     *     </span><br><span class="line">    * *    </span><br><span class="line">   *   *   </span><br><span class="line">  *     *  </span><br><span class="line"> *       * </span><br><span class="line">*         *</span><br><span class="line"> *       * </span><br><span class="line">  *     *  </span><br><span class="line">   *   *   </span><br><span class="line">    * *    </span><br><span class="line">     *</span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure>

<p>The process really took me a long period of time, I soon realized the problem can be solved by the ‘def’ because many tough formula can be put in it.</p>
<hr>
<p>*<em>The second question asked us to print a pascal triangle *</em></p>
<p>In this question, the ‘def’ helped a lot because I didn’t know the direct order about the factorial and the combination, so I made them. (JC means the Chinese character of factorial)</p>
<figure class="highlight python"><table><tr><td class="code"><pre><span class="line"><span class="function"><span class="keyword">def</span> <span class="title">JC</span><span class="params">(x)</span>:</span></span><br><span class="line">    y=<span class="number">1</span></span><br><span class="line">    <span class="keyword">for</span> i <span class="keyword">in</span> range (<span class="number">1</span>,x+<span class="number">1</span>):</span><br><span class="line">        y=y*i </span><br><span class="line">    <span class="keyword">return</span> y</span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure>

<figure class="highlight python"><table><tr><td class="code"><pre><span class="line"><span class="function"><span class="keyword">def</span> <span class="title">C</span><span class="params">(x,y)</span>:</span></span><br><span class="line">    final= int(JC(x)/(JC(x-y)*JC(y)))</span><br><span class="line">    <span class="keyword">return</span> final</span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure>

<p>After that the problem concentrated on the space I needed to give for the triangle because the shape of it was special and between the lines the numbers went like this:</p>
<p><img src="https://s1.ax1x.com/2020/06/17/NZ3yNT.png" alt="NZ3yNT.png"></p>
<p>I soon found that there was a rule so the problem was easy.</p>
<p>Then I need to use two loop structures(‘for i in range’) for each line and the contents in it respectively.</p>
<p>Here is the final work:</p>
<figure class="highlight python"><table><tr><td class="code"><pre><span class="line">H= int(input())</span><br><span class="line">print(<span class="string">' '</span>*H+<span class="string">'1'</span>)</span><br><span class="line"><span class="keyword">for</span> i <span class="keyword">in</span> range(<span class="number">2</span>,H+<span class="number">1</span>):</span><br><span class="line">    <span class="keyword">print</span> (<span class="string">' '</span>*(H-i),end=<span class="string">''</span>)</span><br><span class="line">    <span class="keyword">for</span> x <span class="keyword">in</span> range (i,<span class="number">0</span>,<span class="number">-1</span>):</span><br><span class="line">        print(C(i,x),end=<span class="string">' '</span>)</span><br><span class="line">        print(<span class="string">'1'</span>)</span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure>

<p>The whole process was easier than the first one because I use the ‘def’ to make the formula easier with the numbers input only. </p>
<hr>
<p><em>The encapsulation made the whole process easier to be created and easier to read.</em></p>
<p>This is what I got from this case, before doing the encapsulations the formula in the brackets really bothered me, I will try the method from now on.</p>

    <title>Data Processing Problems(something about eval)</title>
    <url>/2020/05/25/Python2/</url>
    <content><![CDATA[<p>​        <strong>The story started when a problem like this is sent to me.</strong></p>
<p><img src="https://s1.ax1x.com/2020/05/25/tCJIIS.png" alt="tCJIIS.png"></p>
<hr>
<p>Actually it was relatively simple for me, but soon I found there were something that brought me some questions:<br><img src="https://s1.ax1x.com/2020/05/25/tCJKuq.png" alt="tCJKuq.png"></p>
<p>The question asked me to make the function be exactly the same with the example, the input of data must be completed in a pair of brackets with all data in it , which meant I need to work out a way to make the data separated by some special methods that I have never learnt before, I could only make a function like this at first, which was not that perfect:</p>
<figure class="highlight python"><table><tr><td class="code"><pre><span class="line">print(<span class="string">'your principal'</span>)</span><br><span class="line">P = float(input())</span><br><span class="line">print(<span class="string">'What about the annual interest rate?'</span>)</span><br><span class="line">rr= float(input())</span><br><span class="line">print(<span class="string">'what about the duration?'</span>)</span><br><span class="line">nn= float(input())</span><br><span class="line">n=nn*<span class="number">12</span></span><br><span class="line">r=rr/<span class="number">12</span>/<span class="number">100</span></span><br><span class="line"><span class="keyword">if</span> r ==<span class="number">0</span>:</span><br><span class="line">    MP=P/n</span><br><span class="line"><span class="keyword">else</span>:</span><br><span class="line">    MP= P * (r*(<span class="number">1</span>+r)**n)/((<span class="number">1</span>+r)**n<span class="number">-1</span>)</span><br><span class="line">print(MP)</span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure>

<hr>
<p>To solve the brackets problem, I found some information about the way to separate data with a single function nicely, but unfortunately, I failed to find one, because the description about the function was not clear enough or the function never exists.</p>
<p><em>what about changing a way of thinking?</em></p>
<p>I found that the input of data can be separated from the beginning, which meant the separation of the data will be done already. Once again I searched the function with similar effect. I found it : <em>eval</em></p>
<figure class="highlight python"><table><tr><td class="code"><pre><span class="line">OneHaha,TwoHaha=eval(input())</span><br><span class="line">print(OneHaha)</span><br><span class="line">print(TwoHaha)</span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure>

<p>Once I put   <em>1,2</em>   in the function, the value 1 is given to OneHaha, the value 2 is given to TwoHaha. (Nicely!!!)</p>
<p>So the function turned to this:</p>
<figure class="highlight python"><table><tr><td class="code"><pre><span class="line"><span class="comment">#ohhhhhhhhhhhhh</span></span><br><span class="line">P,rr,nn=eval(str(input(<span class="string">'('</span>+<span class="string">'principal, annual_interest_rate, duration '</span>+<span class="string">')'</span>).strip(<span class="string">'()'</span>)))</span><br><span class="line">n=nn*<span class="number">12</span></span><br><span class="line">r=rr/<span class="number">12</span>/<span class="number">100</span></span><br><span class="line"><span class="keyword">if</span> r ==<span class="number">0</span>:</span><br><span class="line">    MP=P/n</span><br><span class="line"><span class="keyword">else</span>:</span><br><span class="line">    MP= P * (r*(<span class="number">1</span>+r)**n)/((<span class="number">1</span>+r)**n<span class="number">-1</span>)</span><br><span class="line">print(MP)</span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure>

<p>(By the way, I used a strip , which could remove the brackets of the input, to make this, I need to turn the input to be exactly the string, so that the strip could deal with its string.)</p>
<hr>
<p>The similar things happened when I was trying to solve the part2: Calculate the remaining balance of a loan.</p>
<p>This is the initial work(old way of input):</p>
<figure class="highlight python"><table><tr><td class="code"><pre><span class="line">print(<span class="string">'principal?'</span>)</span><br><span class="line">P= float(input())</span><br><span class="line">print( <span class="string">"annual interest rate?"</span>)</span><br><span class="line">rr=float(input())</span><br><span class="line">print(<span class="string">'duration?'</span>)</span><br><span class="line">nn=float(input())</span><br><span class="line">print(<span class="string">'number of payments?'</span>)</span><br><span class="line">np=float(input())</span><br><span class="line">r=(rr/<span class="number">100</span>)/<span class="number">12</span></span><br><span class="line">n=nn*<span class="number">12</span></span><br><span class="line"></span><br><span class="line"><span class="keyword">if</span> rr==<span class="number">0</span>:</span><br><span class="line">    RLB=P*(<span class="number">1</span>-np/n)</span><br><span class="line"><span class="keyword">else</span>:</span><br><span class="line">    RLB=P*((<span class="number">1</span>+r)**n-(<span class="number">1</span>+r)**np)/((<span class="number">1</span>+r)**n<span class="number">-1</span>)</span><br><span class="line">print(RLB)</span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure>

<p>Then it turned to this:</p>
<figure class="highlight python"><table><tr><td class="code"><pre><span class="line"><span class="comment">#ohhhhhhhhhhhhh</span></span><br><span class="line">P,rr,nn,np=eval(str(input(<span class="string">'('</span>+<span class="string">'principal, annual_interest_rate, duration , number_of_payments'</span>+<span class="string">')'</span>).strip(<span class="string">'()'</span>)))</span><br><span class="line">P=float(P)</span><br><span class="line">rr=float(rr)</span><br><span class="line">nn=float(nn)</span><br><span class="line">np=float(np)</span><br><span class="line">r=(rr/<span class="number">100</span>)/<span class="number">12</span></span><br><span class="line">n=nn*<span class="number">12</span></span><br><span class="line"></span><br><span class="line"><span class="keyword">if</span> rr==<span class="number">0</span>:</span><br><span class="line">    RLB=P*(<span class="number">1</span>-np/n)</span><br><span class="line"><span class="keyword">else</span>:</span><br><span class="line">    RLB=P*((<span class="number">1</span>+r)**n-(<span class="number">1</span>+r)**np)/((<span class="number">1</span>+r)**n<span class="number">-1</span>)</span><br><span class="line">print(RLB)</span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure>

<p>Amazing isn’t it?</p>
<p>With the experience in part1 and part2, part3 seemed very simple.</p>
<p>Actually,  <strong>it is simple</strong>.<img src="https://s1.ax1x.com/2020/05/25/tCwnFP.png" alt="tCwnFP.png"></p>
<hr>
<p>I also asked my classmates to provide some extra methods that worked like the <em>eval</em>.</p>
<p><em>Here it is:</em></p>
<figure class="highlight python"><table><tr><td class="code"><pre><span class="line">t= list(input())</span><br><span class="line">t= (<span class="string">''</span>.join(t[<span class="number">1</span>:<span class="number">-1</span>])).split(<span class="string">','</span>)</span><br><span class="line">p= float (t[<span class="number">0</span>])</span><br><span class="line">r= float (t[<span class="number">1</span>])</span><br><span class="line">n= float (t[<span class="number">2</span>])</span><br><span class="line">print(p)</span><br><span class="line">print(r)</span><br><span class="line">print(n)</span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure>

<p>(Method provided by Arya, thanks!)</p>
<hr>
<p>I haven’t learnt the function <em>eval</em> yet, so up to now I can only use it in the way I provided above only, I will learn all about this function in the future!</p>
<p><strong><em>GOOD LUCK, Ruiz!</em></strong></p>

    <title>My biggest academic achievement</title>
    <url>/2020/05/01/My-biggest-academic-achievement/</url>
    <content><![CDATA[<h1 id="My-Biggest-Academic-Achievement"><a href="#My-Biggest-Academic-Achievement" class="headerlink" title="My Biggest Academic Achievement"></a>My Biggest Academic Achievement</h1><p>​                As a 16-year-old boy, studying takes up a large proportion of my time, I have achieved lot academically as a student, but my biggest academic achievement was my success in the senior school entrance test.</p>
<p>​                The test took me a lot of time to prepare for last year. All my peers were working very hard on it. It was all about reviewing. The test was mainly on what we had learnt in junior high, a part of the test was even on primary school work, so the range of information was quite time-consuming us to revise. Moreover, there was a huge competition among us: there were 52000 students in Nanjing taking the test to get the chance to study further. </p>
<p>​                The preparation started in the last 2 terms of junior high: We finished learning all of the junior high coursework , which was one and a half terms ahead of the official plan, this allowed us to get a full term for exam preparation. We all made a plan for ourselves according to our ability. An aim was also necessary. My initial plan was to get into the best school in Nanjing. Despite my failure to achieve my objective,my goal gave me a lot of motivation when I nearly gave up. To help us get a better grade our teachers gave us a lot of homework, which was mainly past papers many places around Nanjing or from Nanjing. These papers really worked well because the contents were quite similar to the actual papers. However, we were given a lot of papers so we were exhausted every day. </p>
<p>​                When preparing for the test got too hard some of the students gave up working for the exam, which meant that they went to a relatively bad school. I was the top student in my class, which meant my teacher had great expectations of me, and which put a lot of pressure on me, I started think about the results of the examination, which was the greatest burden on me at that time. After the whole preparation stage, I finished the examination in a few days.</p>
<p>​                The results came out after 3 weeks. Personally speaking, the result I got didn’t meet my expectation and it was not a good one. Among my classmates, I was not even in the top place . Despite all of these problems with my final result, this is my greatest achievement, because the exam was the largest one that I have ever sat. In addition, my grade was relatively good within the group of 52000 students, which meant that I got to go a good senior high school. The achievement could represent my 9-years of-study, and it was good after all.</p>
<p>​                In conclusion, the achievement gave me a new start to my studying career, it was not a bad start and I do believe that I can do better than my peers . I must say that my teachers and parents gave me a lot of support, which helped me get a better grade . I do believe that I will meet their expectations of me next time.</p>

    <title>Difference I found in A-Level center</title>
    <url>/2020/04/02/study-1/</url>
    <content><![CDATA[<p>I chose a quite different way with my initial classmates, which is the international education, for the following 3 years, I will make preparation for my university study in other countries. I really took a lot of time to get used to it , here are the differences I found between the study experience of me in international education and in the traditional education in China.</p>
<h2 id="About-the-teachers"><a href="#About-the-teachers" class="headerlink" title="About the teachers"></a>About the teachers</h2><p>The first lesson I took in the A-Level center is presented by a foreign teacher, whose accent was quite difficult for us to understand, after looking at the contents on the blackboard, I could get 50 percent of the points he taught, which was quite difficult for me at first. We all felt quite disappointed about the teachers in the center because we thought there might be many English teacher with good pronunciations. As one of the best English learner among us, I understood the meaning of our teachers faster than others, I found the teachers were really experienced and patient, they were all willing to help us one by one if we need,  which was a hard thing for the traditional Chinese teachers, that was because Chinese teachers were used to facing a  large amount of students at a time, some of the Chinese teachers would only tell things once so that some students could not get the points well, which was a difficult for me before. Teachers were also willing to have more communication with us , which really helped a lot with our speaking test. </p>
<h2 id="About-my-friends"><a href="#About-my-friends" class="headerlink" title="About my friends"></a>About my friends</h2><p>My classmates were quite different, after having the idea to study further in a foreign university, they were more likely to act as a international student, taking my friend Horan as an example, I found he even changed the language of his phone’s system after getting into the international lessons, I also changed my habit , I started to listen to BBC news instead of the Chinese radios, my friends gave me the idea about how to get used to the English environment. Edison from AS also gave me some help, once he took me to the teachers’ office to talk to our teachers for fun, I started to talk to my new teachers in English from then on with him, I do believe that this can make it much easier to know my teachers well if I keep talking to my teachers in English. This didn’t happen before, I didn’t talk much even with Chinese teachers. My friends really changed me a lot.</p>
<h2 id="About-the-learning-rhythm"><a href="#About-the-learning-rhythm" class="headerlink" title="About the learning rhythm"></a>About the learning rhythm</h2><p>After a quater of the study, it was the time for us to have a monthly exam, I was really surprised when I got to know there would be no revision class for our monthly test. I usually had a week for revision before the monthly test when I was in my junior high, which made most of my classmates only study in those specific weeks massively. Luckily, I did a good job in the beginning of the term in A-Level center, so I didn’t worry about the monthly test very much, simple work for revision after school was enough for me to get a high mark in the exams, from then, I started to realize the importance of the works between the monthly exams, so I worked harder on it than before. Many teachers of me told me that it was the right learning rhythm, but I think the habit was very hard to form when I was taking the traditional education because teachers before usually made the study process very short and give us a lot of time to review the contents, which made me very confused when reviewing. I think the IGCSE lesson we took didn’t have such a problem because we get the knowledge step by step, and the book for us was detailed so we can get all the points, I believe that I can learn better without getting confused and also form a better study habit than before.</p>
